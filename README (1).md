# Cancer Surgery Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing cancer surgery data, identifying trends, and proposing new strategies based on patient outcomes. The data has been visualized and explored to provide answers to key questions, which are presented below.

## Insights and Visualizations

### 1. How does the type of surgery affect long-term patient outcomes?
   - **Best and Worst Performing Surgeries**: 
     - **Lumpectomy** has the highest survival rate.
     - Surgeries categorized as "Other Types" (excluding the three main types) have the lowest survival rate.
   - **Modified Radical Mastectomy**: A dangerous surgery requiring highly experienced doctors, representing a quality indicator for hospitals.

### 2. Age Group Benefit Analysis for Each Surgery
   - **Modified Radical Mastectomy**: Most common between ages **55-59**.
   - **Lumpectomy**: Highest count in ages **60-64**.
   - **Simple Mastectomy**: Most frequent in the **50-54** age group.
   - **Other Surgery Types**: Highest count in ages **55-59**.

### 3. Common Age Group for Cancer Diagnosis Among Males and Females
   - **Women**: Most commonly diagnosed at age **59**.
   - **Men**: Most commonly diagnosed at age **44**.
   - **Policy Recommendation**: Propose regular cancer screenings for women at **age 59** and men at **age 44**.

### 4. Tumor Stage at Diagnosis
   - **Early vs. Late Diagnosis**: 
     - Early-stage diagnoses are linked to effective screening programs.
     - Late-stage diagnoses suggest a need for improved early detection efforts.

### 5. Survival Rate Based on Tumor Stage
   - **Higher Survival Rates**: Patients diagnosed at **early stages** show significantly higher survival rates.
   - **Impact of Early Detection**: Early detection leads to more favorable surgical outcomes and survival chances.

### 6. Distribution of Surgery Types Across Tumor Stages
   - **Stage I**: **Lumpectomy** is the most common, indicating a preference for breast-conserving surgeries.
   - **Stage II**: **Lumpectomy** remains common, but the use of **Modified Radical Mastectomy** increases.
   - **Stage III**: **Modified Radical Mastectomy** becomes the dominant surgery for advanced tumors, reflecting a more aggressive approach.

### 7. Survival After Treatment for Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)
   - **Survival Rate Variations**: 
     - In cases where the survival rate is lower, aggressive treatments may be necessary.
     - Higher survival rates support less aggressive treatments to improve the quality of life.

### 8. Most Common Surgery for Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma
   - **Lumpectomy**: The most frequently performed surgery for patients with ILC, with outcomes varying based on tumor stage and early detection.

### 9. Best Surgical Approach for Different Histology Types
   - **Lumpectomy**: Effective for **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)** and **Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)**.
   - **Simple Mastectomy**: Preferred for **Mucinous Carcinoma**.
