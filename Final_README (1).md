# Project Title: BRCA Clinical and Protein Data Analysis

## Description
This dataset provides clinical and protein expression data for patients with BRCA (Breast Cancer). The dataset includes a range of variables such as patient demographics, protein levels, tumor stage, and treatment information.

## Data Columns:
1. **Patient_ID**: A unique identifier for each patient.
2. **Age**: The age of the patient.
3. **Gender**: The gender of the patient (e.g., FEMALE).
4. **Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4**: Protein expression levels related to the disease.
5. **Tumour_Stage**: The stage of the tumor (e.g., I, II, III).
6. **Histology**: The histological subtype of the tumor (e.g., Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma).
7. **ER status**: Estrogen receptor status (Positive/Negative).
8. **PR status**: Progesterone receptor status (Positive/Negative).
9. **HER2 status**: HER2 protein receptor status (Positive/Negative).
10. **Surgery_type**: The type of surgery performed (e.g., Modified Radical Mastectomy, Lumpectomy).
11. **Date_of_Surgery**: The date the surgery was performed.
12. **Date_of_Last_Visit**: The date of the patient's last follow-up visit.
13. **Patient_Status**: The patient's current status (Alive/Dead).
14. **Tumor_Stage_Numeric**: The numeric representation of the tumor stage (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
15. **Year_of_Surgery**: The year the surgery was performed.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for analyzing the relationships between clinical features and protein expression in BRCA patients, and for investigating potential prognostic factors.

## Notes
- The dataset includes sensitive patient data. Ensure that any usage complies with ethical standards and guidelines.

## The Essential Role of Data Visualization

Data visualization is more than just presenting numbers in a graphical format—it’s the key to unlocking the hidden meanings within complex datasets. By transforming raw data into visual insights, we can bridge the gap between information and understanding. It enables us to quickly identify patterns, spot trends, and make data-driven decisions that are both informed and impactful. Visualization makes the invisible, visible—guiding us from raw information to actionable insights.

Through visual analysis of the dataset, we seek to answer the following crucial questions:

1. What is the most common type of surgery performed among patients?
2. Which type of surgery has the highest success rate in treating breast cancer?
3. Which age group benefits the most from each type of surgery?
4. What is the most common age group among males and females diagnosed with cancer?
5. What is the most common tumor stage at the time of diagnosis?
6. How do tumor stages differ across different age groups and genders?
7. What is the survival rate based on the tumor stage at the time of surgery?
8. How does the type of surgery affect long-term patient outcomes?
9. What is the distribution of surgery types across different tumor stages?
10. Are there differences in tumor stages and outcomes between patients based on the year of surgery?
11. What patterns or trends can be identified in the dataset over time?
12. What percentage of patients diagnosed with Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma survived after treatment?
13. What was the most common type of surgery performed on patients with Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma, and how did it impact survival?
