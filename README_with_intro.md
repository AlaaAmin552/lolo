# Cancer Surgery Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of cancer surgery data to uncover insights regarding the effectiveness of different surgery types, patient survival rates, and trends across various demographics. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how factors like surgery type, patient age, and tumor stage affect long-term outcomes. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, this project aims to guide better decision-making for healthcare providers and inform policy changes.

## Visualizations and Insights

### 1. How does the type of surgery affect long-term patient outcomes?
   - The most effective surgery for long-term outcomes is **Lumpectomy**, showing the highest survival rate. 
   - Conversely, **Modified Radical Mastectomy** is associated with higher risks, indicating it requires specialized medical expertise for better results.

### 2. Which age group benefits the most from each surgery?
   - **Modified Radical Mastectomy**: Most common among patients aged 55-59.
   - **Lumpectomy**: Most common among patients aged 60-64.
   - **Simple Mastectomy**: Most common among patients aged 50-54.
   - **Other Surgeries**: Most common among patients aged 55-59.

### 3. What is the most common age group among males and females diagnosed with cancer?
   - Health agencies should consider cancer screening policies targeting **women at age 59** and **men at age 44**, as these are the most common age groups diagnosed with cancer.

### 4. What is the most common tumor stage at the time of diagnosis?
   - A higher proportion of early-stage diagnoses suggests effective screening programs.
   - A significant number of late-stage diagnoses indicate a need for improved early detection efforts.

### 5. What is the survival rate based on the tumor stage at the time of surgery?
   - Patients diagnosed at earlier stages have significantly higher survival rates.
   - This highlights the importance of early detection in improving outcomes after surgery.

### 6. What is the distribution of surgery types across different tumor stages?
   - **Stage I**: Lumpectomy is the most common procedure, indicating a preference for breast-conserving surgery in early-stage cancer.
   - **Stage II**: Lumpectomy remains prevalent, but the use of **Modified Radical Mastectomy** increases.
   - **Stage III**: **Modified Radical Mastectomy** becomes the dominant surgery, reflecting more aggressive interventions in advanced stages.

### 7. What percentage of patients diagnosed with Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma survived after treatment?
   - For **Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma**, when the survival rate is low, more aggressive treatments may be necessary.
   - High survival rates might justify less invasive treatments to reduce side effects and improve quality of life.

### 8. What was the most common surgery performed on patients with Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma, and how did it impact survival?
   - **Lumpectomy** was the most frequently performed surgery for Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma, showing favorable survival outcomes.

### 9. What is the best surgery for each histology type?
   - **Lumpectomy**: Preferred for both **Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)** and **Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)**.
   - **Simple Mastectomy**: Most effective for **Mucinous Carcinoma**.
